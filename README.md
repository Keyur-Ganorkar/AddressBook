Hello, my name is Keyur and I am an experienced web developer. 
As a part of my Full Stack Web Development course on Udemy, I created a client address book project.
The project was initially coded in the mid months of 2023 before I learned how to use Git. 
Recently, I uploaded the project, which is a full-stack application, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
The project consists of several pages such as login, data view, edit data, and logout options.
Although the project is simple, I am still working on improving its design. 
I am confident that this project will help others understand how to use the web development stack.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about this project. Stay tuned for more exciting projects to come!
